### Introduction

The DO Lectures brings together the world’s disruptors, change–makers, experts and pioneers to share their stories and encourage others to go and DO.

Since then, DO has evolved into an institution dedicated to bringing the creative underdog the best teachings, inspiration and thought around. Starting with an annual event on a farm in west Wales, it has grown into an event held across four countries, a sister book company, an educational platform, a whole host of workshops and other one-day events, and one of the largest resources of inspiration on the web.

### The Brief

DO came to us amidst the pandemic with a timely need to bring their digital touch–points together behind a more homogenous brand expressive of their open and encouraging personality, communication style and content. Central to this is was their website and supporting newsletter; as the engine that drives them forwards, enabling them to reach the widest audience possible with their online learning and courses.

### Approach

Core to DO’s digital strategy was the aim of bringing that irresistible spirit and atmosphere of their in–person events, online. And so we started with the challenge of how to bring people into the world of DO through their site.

It was important to us that newcomers to the site would not feel intimidated by the impressive breadth of DO's archive. The customer journey was therefore built around a crucial point of access, taking due consideration of how to educate users and showcase all of DO's themes, content pillars and background, without overwhelming them.

By reducing the amount of initial content shown to the user, we avoided any chance of choice paralysis whilst giving a bite–size flavour of what DO is about. Their talks were the ideal focal point, so we surfaced these and ensured they were easy to find, consume and share. A visitor could then make easier choices, with freedom to explore and digest content at a more manageable pace, with curated recommendations made along the way.

We also focused on breaking content up, and making it delightful. With our digital attention spans ever in decline, the interface design needed to kindle people’s curiosity in the wonderfully inspiring advice The Do Lectures offer. The richness and quality of their content was given the presentation to match, and we introduced related features in the margins to make content 'visually snackable'. We sprinkled little moments of surprise throughout the site too, taking the form of hover animations and character pop ups to make sure DO’s conviviality wouldn’t go unnoticed.

Once eased in through a world of curious content, we needed to next immerse people in the community. However, recreating this in the digital realm with forums, live chat rooms or complex platforms requiring community management and moderation felt a bit insincere. We wanted to give people on the site the sense that you there, in real–time, amongst others too. Introducing a simple set of questions at the end of each piece of content generates reflection, suggestion and commentary, giving people a tangible sense of their valuable place and participation in the DO community.

With their sprightly personality, renowned content and energetic community coming to life on the site; the final undertaking was a cohesive brand expression to unify and represent these pillars. We evolved this to encompass more visual language opportunities and to ensure consistency across DO’s digital properties. Elements were taken from around the DO Farm and its surroundings, where the Lectures take place, to create a colourful, textural identity that could flex to give the consistency needed across the different ‘worlds’ inspired by DO. The brand palette makes more generous use of their playful, illustrative characters, representing the community, the contributors, and the user–generated side of the platform. The new site combines this vibrant brand world with straight-forward UX to provide the best experience for the creative underdog.

### Technical Approach

DO’s broad portfolio of content and products required a large and carefully considered system architecture. Essentially, they had a _tonne_ of data, connections and integrations, calling for a comprehensive technical approach to accommodate all its needs.

We began by examining the internal processes of how products and content were managed and created at DO HQ, helping us to sketch out the architecture needed to support the site’s wide and varied requirements. We found a somewhat fragmented customer journey, with users being taken away from the site into new tabs or sister sites, leaving the DO team in the dark as to what happens thereafter. The relationships between these separate domains were a cause for confusion, leaving users uncertain about which content was the most recent. Users were also more prone to trying to discover content rather than knowing already what they were looking for.
