### Introduction

After spending a decade sharing the ideas, strategies and creative thinking to help others to achieve their dreams, The DO Lectures lacked a brand and website that echoed this thinking.

We collaborated with their team to help bring about a new era for the Welsh based company by creating a digital hub for all things DO. This meant bringing together their wealth of creative content including 400+ talks, 300+ articles, speaker bios, reading lists, courses and events.

### Challenge

With three different offerings and goals, we created three individual sites. One which would help to enhance the runway experience and allow for Daniel and his team to develop, mature and progress with each collection.

Another which was an immersive 360 video experience of Del Core's latest show and the last being a private site for buyers and wholesalers to view the collection and set up meetings.These sites allowed for Daniel and his team to move forward with confidence and have dedicated spaces for each area of the business.

### Navigation

We introduced a simplified navigation system for each collection which brought the next look directly to the user. With buyers being our main target audience, we wanted them to have the ability to view a collection quickly and efficiently.

### Made to Measure

As well as showing off the latest collection, the site had to display another of Del Core's unique offerings of Made to Measure. We wanted users to feel excited and inspired by the possibilities that Made to Measure offered them.
