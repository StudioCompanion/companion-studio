### Introduction

We were asked by Lane & Associates to partner with them and help to launch a new site for fashion designer Daniel Del Core. Before founding his own fashion label, Daniel worked for Gucci designing bespoke dresses and outfits for people like Bjork, Lana Del Rey and Florence Welch.

Now with a new challenge ahead of him, Daniel was in need of a site that would showcase his collections, give buyers the opportunity to request viewings and highlight his unique offering of 'Made to Measure', bespoke pieces hand made by Daniel himself.

### Challenge

With three different offerings and goals, we created three individual sites. One which would help to enhance the runway experience and allow for Daniel and his team to develop, mature and progress with each collection.

Another which was an immersive 360 video experience of Del Core's latest show and the last being a private site for buyers and wholesalers to view the collection and set up meetings.These sites allowed for Daniel and his team to move forward with confidence and have dedicated spaces for each area of the business.

### Navigation

We introduced a simplified navigation system for each collection which brought the next look directly to the user. With buyers being our main target audience, we wanted them to have the ability to view a collection quickly and efficiently.

### Made to Measure

As well as showing off the latest collection, the site had to display another of Del Core's unique offerings of Made to Measure. We wanted users to feel excited and inspired by the possibilities that Made to Measure offered them.
