    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Our aim was to bring more <strong>familiar</strong> design patterns to
      Alexander that ensured it was more <i>accessible</i> and usable for the
      audience, whilst retaining the charm that the Alexander team liked of the
      current application. <a href="#">Here is a link.</a> We did this by
      undertaking discovery workshops with the Alexander team to find out what
      they felt had been working for them and what areas we needed to address.

      We broke down our findings from these discovery sessions into three main
      areas. Discovery of content, utilisation of features and creating clear
      communication of the apps propositon and offering.
