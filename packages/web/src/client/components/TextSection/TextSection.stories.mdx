    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Our aim was to bring more familiar design patterns to Alexander that
      ensured it was more accessible and usable for the audience, whilst
      retaining the charm that the Alexander team liked of the current
      application. We did this by undertaking discovery workshops with the
      Alexander team to find out what they felt had been working for them and
      what areas we needed to address.
    </p>
    <p>
      We broke down our findings from these discovery sessions into three main
      areas. Discovery of content, utilisation of features and creating clear
      communication of the apps propositon and offering.
