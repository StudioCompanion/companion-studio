		<div class="text-holder">
			<p>We can work as an extension of you, or as an autonomous group. We prefer long-term relationships, so we tend to speak our mind openly as after all, your interests are our interests.</p>

		<div class="text-holder">
			<p>Every digital project is different and needs a flexible approach, so we focus on finding the most appropriate solutions for you, rather than trying to have you jump through hoops.</p>

		<div class="text-holder">
			<p>We believe the best digital experiences aren't an afterthought. We like to be involved from the beginning, planning, diving deep and working out where the most value can be added.</p>

		<div class="text-holder">
			<p>Having fun and playing is the best way to create. That’s why we don’t do free pitches, overwork our team or embrace the burnout culture of the creative industry. Sorry, it’s not fun.</p>
